<p>i am clan's bot ,I'm here to help you understand more about sustainable life style.
    Sustainable living is based on four main pillars namely minimizing waste, limiting the use of Earth’s natural resources, the wise use of the environment, and ensuring quality working/living environments
It can be achieved by: Investing in reusable products may seem unnecessary and comparatively expensive than regular plastic alternatives.
    But in the long run, they help save resources, reduce waste and also save money.
    Carry your reusable cutlery, water bottle to avoid single-use plastics.
    Swap your single-use plastic straws with steel/glass straws or reusable silicone straws.
    Support local organic stores and small eco-friendly businesses.
    sustainability is important because,From extreme weather, sea-level rise to alarming rates of species extinction, we are witnessing the destruction of our very planet every single day and yet manage to live in hopes that someone else will save it.
    By making simple lifestyle changes, you have the opportunity to decrease your carbon footprint, save money, improve your quality of life while contributing to environmental conservation.
    Living sustainably often gets a bad rap for being expensive — but if you do it right, you could actually end of saving money.
    Things like shopping in the bulk section, only buying seasonal or local produce, shopping secondhand, reducing food waste, taking public transportation, and using reusable napkins, containers, etc. can actually be more affordable than the alternative, and therefore save you money.
    There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use of resources, composting, relying on clean energy sources, reducing your consumption of single-use plastic, eating less animal products, shopping for clothing and other items sustainably, buying local, and more.
